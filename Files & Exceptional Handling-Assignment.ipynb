    "#Scenario-Applications that perform a lot of i/o operations,such as reading from or writing to files,network communications,or interacting with databases.\n",
    "#Reason-Multithreading is effective for i/o-bound tasks because threads can be used to perform i/o operations concurrently.While one thread waits for i/o operations to complete,other threads can continue executing,leading to better overall utilization of system resources.\n",
